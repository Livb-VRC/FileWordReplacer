# FileWordReplacer
This program is used to copy all the files and subfolders from a folder and rename all the same files contents, filename and folders to whichever words we choose to replace. So it's good for example to make code templates

Right now it just does this for .java files but I plan on making a new release soon that allows to select other types or all files
